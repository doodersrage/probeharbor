/**
 * Escapes a single CSV field, guarding against two separate risks:
 *
 * 1. CSV structural characters (commas, quotes, newlines) -- wrapped in
 *    quotes with internal quotes doubled, the standard CSV escaping rule.
 * 2. "CSV injection" / formula injection: a field that starts with =, +,
 *    -, @, tab, or CR is interpreted as a formula (or formula-like) by
 *    Excel/Sheets/LibreOffice when the exported file is opened there, and
 *    can be used to run commands (via a legacy DDE formula) or exfiltrate
 *    data (via a formula that fetches a remote URL). Every CSV export in
 *    this app can contain user-supplied text -- contact form messages,
 *    device/probe names, alert titles -- so all of them route through
 *    this one function rather than each export reimplementing (and
 *    potentially forgetting) the guard.
 *
 * Mitigation follows OWASP's guidance: prefix a leading single quote so
 * spreadsheet apps render the value as literal text instead of evaluating
 * it as a formula.

// A bare integer or decimal (optionally signed) is never a formula threat
